# php-pdfmake

### Create a pdf on the server side using php and render it on the web browser!

* NOTE: Not all features are implemented yet but the ones that are available are fully functionally!!!

This php wrapper of PDFMake use the same style syntax using php objects! 

* So if there are no class referencing a property or object of pdfmake for the moment just create an object in php manually using $object = new stdClass().
* Then just add it to one of the pdfmake properties and everything shoul work fine!
* Every root property is already declared in the pdfmake class instance!
* You could still declared objects inside nested objects and create a fully functionally pdfmake document structure using php objects!
* The trick over here is the json encode function which encodes everything with the names of the properties declared on the server side as javascript objects of the pdfmake library ;).
* Enjoy
